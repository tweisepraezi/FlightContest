Problem:
    Skytraq Venus chipset does not have a correct UTC time


https://github.com/GPSBabel/gpsbabel/issues/70
    Skytraq Venus 6 leap seconds added

    <para>
    gps_utc_offset is used to override the built-in table of offsets of
    the offset between GPS time and UTC time. This chipset reports only 
    GPS time to the host and relies on software to know every time an adjustment
    is made. Since GPS time offsets can change without a new version of GPSBabel
    is released, those that care about total accuracy can override it.

    <screen>
    <command>gpsbabel</command>
    -i skytraq.bin,gps_utc_offset=15 -f <replaceable>filename.bin</replaceable>
    </screen>

    Indicates that GPS is ahead of UTC by fifteen seconds, as was the case in 2009.
