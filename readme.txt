Flight Contest is a tool to schedule aviation power flying competitions (Precision Flying, Air Rally Flying, Air Navigation Race) and to evaluate planning, navigation, observation and/or landing test results.

Flight Contest features flexible competition management, particularly supporting
* Several competition rules (FAI, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, expandable; adjustment of individual evaluation details (points) possible, should the need arise)
* Competition classes (different evaluation of groups of crews participating in a competition)
* Combined competitions (competitions taking place at the same time with the same competitors participating in)
* Parallel competitions (competitions taking place at the same time with different competitors participating in)
* The evaluation of specific groups of crews, which can be determined on an ad hoc basis
